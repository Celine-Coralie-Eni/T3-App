# 🚀 GitOps Deployment Pipeline Guide

## 📋 Project Overview
Deploy a Next.js T3 Stack todo app through a complete GitOps pipeline:
**GitHub → CI/CD → Docker → Terraform → AWS ECS → FQDN**

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand GitOps principles and workflow
- Master Docker containerization concepts
- Learn Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- Deploy to AWS ECS with proper networking
- Set up automated CI/CD pipelines

---

## 📚 Phase 1: Understanding the Architecture

### What is GitOps?
GitOps is a deployment methodology where:
- **Git is the single source of truth** for infrastructure and application code
- **Automated processes** deploy changes when code is pushed
- **Declarative configurations** define desired state
- **Continuous monitoring** ensures actual state matches desired state

**📖 Read:** [GitOps Principles](https://www.gitops.tech/)

### Architecture Flow
```
Developer → Git Push → GitHub Actions → Build Docker Image → 
Push to ECR → Terraform Apply → ECS Deployment → Load Balancer → FQDN
```

---

## 🐳 Phase 2: Containerization (Docker)

### Why Docker?
- **Consistency:** Same environment everywhere (dev, staging, prod)
- **Isolation:** App runs in its own container
- **Scalability:** Easy to scale horizontally
- **Portability:** Runs anywhere Docker runs

**📖 Read:** [Docker Official Docs](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)

### Key Docker Concepts:
- **Image:** Blueprint for containers (like a class)
- **Container:** Running instance of an image (like an object)
- **Dockerfile:** Instructions to build an image
- **Registry:** Storage for Docker images (ECR, Docker Hub)

### Tasks:
1. Create production Dockerfile
2. Optimize for Next.js production builds
3. Handle environment variables securely
4. Test locally before deployment

---

## ☁️ Phase 3: Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

### Why Terraform?
- **Declarative:** Describe what you want, not how to get it
- **Version Control:** Infrastructure changes tracked in Git
- **Reproducible:** Same infrastructure every time
- **Multi-cloud:** Works with AWS, Azure, GCP

**📖 Read:** [Terraform AWS Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs)

### Key Terraform Concepts:
- **Resources:** Infrastructure components (EC2, RDS, VPC)
- **Providers:** Cloud platform integrations
- **State:** Current infrastructure state tracking
- **Modules:** Reusable infrastructure components

### AWS Components We'll Create:
- **VPC:** Virtual Private Cloud (network isolation)
- **Subnets:** Network segments (public/private)
- **Security Groups:** Firewall rules
- **Application Load Balancer:** Traffic distribution
- **ECS Cluster:** Container orchestration
- **RDS:** Managed PostgreSQL database
- **Route53:** DNS management

---

## 🔄 Phase 4: CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

### Why GitHub Actions?
- **Integrated:** Built into GitHub
- **Event-driven:** Triggers on push, PR, etc.
- **Flexible:** Custom workflows
- **Secure:** Built-in secrets management

**📖 Read:** [GitHub Actions Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

### Pipeline Stages:
1. **Trigger:** Code push to main branch
2. **Test:** Run unit tests and linting
3. **Build:** Create Docker image
4. **Push:** Upload image to AWS ECR
5. **Deploy:** Update ECS service with new image

---

## 🏗️ Phase 5: AWS ECS Deployment

### Why ECS?
- **Managed:** AWS handles infrastructure
- **Scalable:** Auto-scaling based on demand
- **Integrated:** Works with other AWS services
- **Cost-effective:** Pay for what you use

**📖 Read:** [Amazon ECS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ecs/)

### ECS Components:
- **Cluster:** Group of compute resources
- **Service:** Maintains desired number of tasks
- **Task Definition:** Blueprint for containers
- **Task:** Running container instance
